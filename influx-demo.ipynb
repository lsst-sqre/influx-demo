    "# Influx stack demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we present the main concepts of InfluxDB. The we use the influxdb Python client to get SQuaSH metrics into InflunxDB. We demonstrate the use of Chronograf for data exploration and dashboarding, and Kapacitor for creating alerting rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- InfluxDB [getting-started guide]( https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.6/introduction/getting-started/)\n",
    "- SQL to InfluxDB [terminology crosswalk](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/crosswalk/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Points\" are discrete samples of a metric. Points are written to InfluxDB using the \"Line Protocol\":\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<measurement>[,<tag-key>=<tag-value>...] <field-key>=<field-value>[,<field2-key>=<field2-value>...] [unix-nano-timestamp]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Measurements\" acts as a container for tags, fields, and the time column, and the measurement name is the description of the data that are stored in the associated fields. Measurement names are strings. A measurement is conceptually similar to an SQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags are indexed while fields are not. So you should consider to turn fields into tags if you they are used to constraint your queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Insert a single time series point using the CLI\n",
    "\n",
